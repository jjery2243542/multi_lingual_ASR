# semi-supervised ASR
## TODO list 
- [ ] decoder with N-best generation (keep the log-probability)
- [ ] feature: npy, text -> pickle with multiple utterance
- [ ] skip length < 10 or length > 2000  
- [ ] max-char = 400
- [ ] dataset, data loader(part loader to speedup, short to long scheduling)
- [ ] judge network
