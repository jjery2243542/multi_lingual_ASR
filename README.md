# semi-supervised ASR
## TODO list 
- [ ] decoder with N-best generation (keep the log-probability)
- [ ] find out whether the judge learns meaningful rewards.
- [ ] Use feature matching loss to stablize training.
- [ ] Train the discrimiator with moving average accuracy (follow [Real-Time Adaptive Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05823)).
- [ ] Only train cell.
- [ ] Implement approximate embedding layer.
- [ ] One-side label smoothing.
